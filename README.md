You need to run the Game.java to start the game.
After you start the Game, you can see un windows.
First,you need to press the button "ENTER",and you can enter your name
Then,you need to press the button "HEROCHOOSE",you can choose how many heros you want to have and which type of hero you want to choose
After you finish the "HEROCHOOSE" part,you can press "show item" and "show properties" to show the items and properties of each hero
Then,you can press "START GAME" to start the game.
And you can play the game at the top scene.
When you play,you can press "ROUND NUMBER" to know which round you are playing, and in this game it only have 5 rounds.

At this programe,
I implemented all the features required on the request, for example, you choose 2 heroes, there will be 2 monsters per round (the last round is a boss), how a character Hp is less than or equal to 0, then it will be removed from the list, etc.
At the same time, I also used javafx to implement features such as image display and button usage, which also includes switching between two windows, switching data between two windows, etc.
